# Syllaby Test

- This project used react vite app
- Strict linting is enabled for clean code
- Typescript app
  - With all types defined
  - Used absolute paths
- Can update useAuth isLoggedIn to false for protected routes to work correctly
- Used Context for Book Saving
  - Can Use Redux Toolkit for large scale apps
  - Used state to manage the form state
    - For larger and more complex forms I prefer to user react-form-hook
  - All the permission levels are implemented in Permission hook
    - So only Author can delete it
    - Collaborator can Edit it
    - Reader can only view it
    - Private routes are also added
  - I used inline css for layout and App.css for generic styling
    - I prefer to use tailwind for such purposes
      - Or use AntD or MUI - Design system
    - Components were not that complex or had variety else storybook can also be implemented
- Its not the finished product but it meets the requirements of a demo task and how my coding is usually like
  - I have mentioned the changes I will do, if it was a large scale project
  - I like to keep components just like this small
  - I am mostly coding in NextJS so work with page or app router
  - I use a lot of custom hooks to keep the core logic and redundant logic separate
- I couldn't record a such long video that I could upload somewhere, it wasn't feasible for me.
- If you want me to make further improvements, or want to discuss further I will be more than happy to comply
- Thanks
